Kassia
======
Kassia is a scoring program for creating music written in Byzantine notation. It takes an XML file (schema file to be released later), parses the neumes and lyrics, and generates a formatted PDF using [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.com)

The neumes used in Kassia come from [St. Anthony's Monastery] (http://www.stanthonysmonastery.org/music/ByzMusicFonts.html).
